# MinNet Training Process
Here is a demonstration on training a MinNet using the human bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) data. Trained model is able to be applied to any BMMC or PBMC data integration.

## Training dataset
The training dataset we used to train model is from [GSE194122](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE194122) processed H5AD file.
For results in manuscript figures, we kept only batches s1d1, s1s3, s2d1, s2d4, s2d5, s3d3, s3d6, and s3d10![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42524290/163040664-b74a484d-b569-45e4-81b4-fd432661ec8e.png)
